COMPILATION of ARIBAS (V. 1.53, Nov. 2004)
To compile ARIBAS for LINUX on a 80386 (or higher) computer, the 
following 26 files are necessary.

a) 23 C-Files

alloc.c     analysis.c  aritaux.c   arith.c     aritool0.c  aritools.c
aritx.c     arity.c     aritz.c     array.c     control.c   errtext.c
eval.c      file.c      mainloop.c  mem0.c      parser.c    print.c
scanner.c   storage.c   syntchk.c   sysdep.c    terminal.c

b) 2 Include-Files

logscr.inc 	(included by terminal.c)
common.h	(common header file)

c) One Assembler File

arito386.S

Only the file arito386.S is in this directory, the files are in
the parent directory. To compile ARIBAS, proceed as follows

1) Copy the files
        arito386.S   and   Makefile.linux
   to the parent directory.

2) Change to the parent directory. This should now contain all
   the files mentioned in a), b), c).

3) Rename Makefile.linux to makefile by the command

	mv Makefile.linux makefile

   and start compilation by

	make

   Renaming the makefile is not necessary if you use the command
   	make -f Makefile.linux

   If you don't like makefiles, the single command line

	gcc -DLiNUX -O -o aribas *.c *.S

   will also do it. (This supposes that the only files with extension
   .c and .S  in the current directory are those mentioned in a),b),c).)

After successful compilation, the executable file aribas will have
been created. You may then remove all .o files. (This can be done 
with the command 'make clean')
  

INSTALLATION

To run ARIBAS, only the executable file aribas is necessary. 
Move it to a directory which is in the PATH variable. If
you want online-help, you need also the file aribas.hlp, which
must be placed in a directory which is in the PATH variable.
There is also an interface to run ARIBAS within the GNU Emacs
editor (version 19.xx or higher). The necessary Emacs Lisp file is
aribas.el in the subdirectory EL. Please read the corresponding
README file.
