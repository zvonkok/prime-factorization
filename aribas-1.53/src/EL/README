The file aribas.el provides the Emacs interface for ARIBAS

To be able to run ARIBAS from within Emacs, the file aribas.el
must be in the load-path of Emacs. If this is not the case, you
can extend the load-path by customizing your .emacs file.
If for example aribas.el is in the directory /usr/local/lib/aribas,
then write the following Elisp command into .emacs

	(setq load-path (cons "/usr/local/lib/aribas" load-path))

If aribas.el is in the subdirectory el of your home directory,
you can write

	(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/el") load-path))

Furthermore, put the following lines into your .emacs file

	(autoload 'run-aribas "aribas"
     		"Run ARIBAS." t)

Then, after the next start of Emacs, you can run ARIBAS from within
Emacs by giving the command

  	M-x run-aribas

(If you don't have a META key, use ESC x instead of M-x)
Then ARIBAS will be loaded into an Emacs window with name 
*aribas* and you can edit your input to ARIBAS with the usual
Emacs commands.

If your input ends with a full stop '.' and you press RETURN,
it is sent to ARIBAS.
If however your complete input does not end with a full stop,
(for example in response to a readln), the input is sent 
to ARIBAS by C-j (Control-j) or C-c RETURN.

If you want to repeat a previous input, M-p (or ESC p) cycles backward
through input history, and M-n (or ESC n) cycles forward.

A Control-C is sent to ARIBAS by C-c C-c (press C-c twice).
